1. Fork the repository.
1. Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`. The branch is in your repository so the naming is up to you, be creative !
1. Commit and push the topic branch.
1. Make a pull request.

### Submit ideas

1. You don't know how or don't have the time to contribute ? Don't hesitate to share your ideas in issues
1. First look at the open issues so that you don't create duplicates.
